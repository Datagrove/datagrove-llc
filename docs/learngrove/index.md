# LearnGrove - Coming Soon

## A Community of Learning
LearnGrove aims to establish a community marketplace for educational resources, including both free and paid offerings. This innovative platform serves as a comprehensive hub where creators can share - and clients can discover - tailored educational resources. While initially centered on digital educational materials, future expansions may include event listings and ticketing, as well as services like tutoring and expert presentations. By bridging the gap between creators and consumers, we aspire to enhance access to high-quality educational content while fostering a thriving community of learners and educators.
