# About Datagrove

Datagrove products are all about making things easier, more efficient, and more secure while taking into consideration our impact on the world around us. Trees inspire us in many ways - tree structures represent an efficient method of data storage and even small groups of trees (groves!) can grow to be mighty forests.

## Our Name
As a startup we always want to remember our roots and thus our name was created: Datagrove. Efficiency, sustainable growth, and standing the test of time.

## The Datagrove
The Datagrove ecosystem is designed to grow over time just like the trees from which we draw our inspiration. The Datagrove “root system” is our unique data management that is designed for security, traceability, and end-user invisibility. The system runs in the background keeping the whole tree nourished and thriving. From those roots we are growing product branches that solve real world problems.
